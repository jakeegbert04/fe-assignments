/* 
Dynamic Navbar

- I don't care what content you have in the navbar
  - ex: logo on the left, links on the right
- Media queries ot make the navbar responsive
  - at a particular, display a hamburger icon instead of links
  - using js, make the hamburger "open" and "close" the menu to show links

Hint: 
 - start with the pieces (html skeleton, styles, media queries, js)
 - don't get hung up on 1 piece
